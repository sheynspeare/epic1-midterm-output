<h1> :fire: Mandala x Modern Batik :fire: </h1>

<p>
DID YOU KNOW that mandalas are initially used as <b>religious symbols</b>? Though, of course, since the time has passed so much, its usage is not limited to spiritual symbolisms anymore—it’s even used for aesthetics now! Wall design, clothes, tapestries, and even nail art. The sky is basically the limit as of the modern days.
One of the most known people to ever use mandala patterns are the Indians. It plays a crucial role in their religion, and they even make tattoos with the said pattern, especially women.
  
BUT WHAT IF a mandala pattern becomes Filipino inspired? I mean yes, Filipinos already have majestic-centuries-old-tattoo patterns or locally called **batik**—but what if we give it a touch of modern design? Like y'know, the current generation are pretty much drawn to minimalism. So how about we add a teeny-tiny bit of it? I mean, batik is known for its **intricate details** or a somewhat crowded pattern. Integrating all of these, how do you think it would look like?

I used pentagons to make the <b>8 sunrays</b> that are typically found in the Philippine Flag (symbolizes the first 8 provinces that courageously defied and revolted against the Spaniards). I didn’t stick with just making it directly because I thought, using a pentagon would be a great help in adding more dimension in the pattern, since I won’t just end up with sunrays, but other shapes too—hitting two birds in one stone, I guess. I also didn’t stick with a perfect circle for the center part because I didn’t want it to look too common, instead I turned the center into a disk. After securing the two main features I wanted to see in my mandala, I just explored on some more patterns while still giving extra emphasis on the circles since mandalas are typically circles… and well, mandala, being a Sanskrit, literally translates to “circle”.
  
And I don’t know about you, but I bet this pattern could pass as Dr. Strange’s magic circle if he was Pinoy :sunglasses:
